# Candy Crush

This is a Candy Crush game built in React.

## Features

- Displays a grid of candy images.
- Implements basic game logic for checking matches and replacing candies.
- Allows users to drag and drop candies to make matches.

## Dependencies

This application relies on React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for state management and event handling.

## Implementation Notes

- It generates a random initial arrangement of candies on the board.
- It continuously checks for matches (rows and columns) and replaces candies when matches are found.
- Users can drag and drop candies to make matches. The component handles drag and drop events to update the board accordingly.
